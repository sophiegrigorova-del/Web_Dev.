      <p>Oxytocin—known variously as the “love hormone” and the “cuddle hormone”—is released by dog brains, too. It enables them to fall in love with both dogs and humans, and you are not one to question their lifestyle choices nor whom they deign to love.</p>

      <p>A 2003 study from The Veterinary Record revealed that merely petting a dog infected with a parasitic roundworm known as Toxocara canis can transmit the parasite to humans, at which point the roundworm can nestle in the back of your eyeball and eventually make you go blind. So…pet with caution and wash your hands.</p>

They are known for their strong sense of smell, ability to learn over 100 words, and diverse breeds that vary widely in size and appearance. Most pet dogs have an average lifespan of 10–13 years.</p>
