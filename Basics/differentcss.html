     <p>  My all-time favorite dessert would have to be a <strong>Brownie Sundae</strong>. 
  A popular ice cream dessert featuring a thick, fudgy brownie as a base, topped with scoops of ice cream, 
  and then garnished with classic sundae toppings such as hot fudge sauce, whipped cream, nuts, and sprinkles. 
  It combines warm, rich brownies with cold, creamy ice cream and a variety of sweet accompaniments, 
  making it an indulgent and classic treat. </p>
